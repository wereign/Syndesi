## How to use it
**Note:** Syndesi is still extremely premature, and will break in any unusual circumstance. Heck,the underlying logic is running in Python by a command line :). There's a lot to be done, but I was too eager to show off the initial prototype and get some feedback!

1. Open any markdown file in your Vault.
2. Press Ctrl (Cmd for Mac Users) + P, and the choose the `Syndesi: Convert Current Document to Mindmap` option.
3. This should result in a new canvas file in your workspace, which will be your notes created into cards
